## 🚀 Overview

**Delhi Sudarshan** is a centralized command center designed to streamline public grievance redressal. Unlike traditional apps that require citizens to be tech-savvy, Sudarshan uses a **Voice-First (Zero-UI)** approach. 

It acts as an **intelligent middleware** that tunnels into existing government legacy databases, enabling real-time AI surveillance, corruption checks, and instant citizen communication without requiring expensive data migration.

## ✨ Key Features (The USP)

### 🕵️‍♂️ The "Surprise Audit" (Anti-Corruption Loop)
* **Trust, but Verify:** The system doesn't just log complaints; it verifies them. 
* **One-Click Cluster Audit:** The Nodal Officer can trigger a random verification check with a single click. The AI Agent targets a **citizen group** (clustered by specific Area and Department) and calls them to verify if the work claimed by the contractor was actually completed.
* **Corruption Flagging:** If the citizens deny the resolution, the entire cluster is immediately flagged for inspection and marked as "Work Not Done."

### 🚇 Legacy Tunneling Architecture
* **Zero-Migration:** Instead of replacing old government SQL servers (which is costly and slow), Sudarshan acts as a **Stateless Overlay**.
* **Seamless Integration:** It "tunnels" into legacy MCD/PWD databases to read/write data, allowing for instant deployment at 10% of the cost of traditional digital transformation.

### ⚡ Sub-500ms Latency (Real-Time)
* **Gemini 2.5 Native Audio:** We bypass traditional Speech-to-Text delays. By streaming raw audio tokens, our voice agent (`Vaani`) responds in **under 500ms**, making the conversation feel natural and human-like during emergencies.

### 🎙️ Zero-UI Accessibility
* **No App Required:** Designed for the 47% of the population that is elderly or digitally illiterate.
* **Language Agnostic:** The system speaks fluid Hindi and English, bridging the digital divide.
