## 🚀 Overview

**Delhi Sudarshan** is a centralized command center designed to streamline public grievance redressal. Unlike traditional apps that require citizens to be tech-savvy, Sudarshan uses a **Voice-First (Zero-UI)** approach. 

It acts as an **intelligent middleware** that tunnels into existing government legacy databases, enabling real-time AI surveillance, corruption checks, and instant citizen communication without requiring expensive data migration.

## ✨ Key Features (The USP)

### 🎙️ Zero-UI Accessibility
* **No App Required:** Designed for the 47% of the population that is elderly or digitally illiterate.
* **Language Agnostic:** The system speaks fluid Hindi and English, bridging the digital divide.

### 🕵️‍♂️ The "Surprise Audit" (Anti-Corruption Loop)
* **Trust, but Verify:** The system doesn't just log complaints; it verifies them. 
* **One-Click Cluster Audit:** The Nodal Officer can trigger a random verification check with a single click. The AI Agent targets a **citizen group** (clustered by specific Area and Department) and calls them to verify if the work claimed by the contractor was actually completed.
* **Corruption Flagging:** If the citizens deny the resolution, the entire cluster is immediately flagged for inspection and marked as "Work Not Done."

### 🚇 Legacy Tunneling Architecture
* **Zero-Migration:** Instead of replacing old government SQL servers (which is costly and slow), Sudarshan acts as a **Stateless Overlay**.
* **Seamless Integration:** It "tunnels" into legacy MCD/PWD databases to read/write data, allowing for instant deployment at 10% of the cost of traditional digital transformation.

### ⚡ Sub-500ms Latency (Real-Time)
* **Gemini 2.5 Native Audio:** We bypass traditional Speech-to-Text delays. By streaming raw audio tokens, our voice agent (`Vaani`) responds in **under 500ms**, making the conversation feel natural and human-like during emergencies.

### 🛡️ Human-in-the-Loop (Ethical Guardrails)
* **AI Efficiency, Human Authority:** The AI autonomously handles intake, categorization, department routing, and priority verification. However, it **cannot reject** a complaint.
* **Mandatory Officer Review:** The power to reject is strictly reserved for the Nodal Officer. If a complaint is invalid, the officer must manually reject it and record a specific reason. 
* **Automated Feedback:** Once rejected by the officer, the AI Agent immediately calls the citizen to explain the specific reason for rejection, ensuring total transparency.

### 📞 Proactive "Don't Call Us" Model
* **Outbound-First Communication:** We flipped the traditional model. Citizens do not need to call daily to check their status.
* **Event-Triggered Updates:** The AI Agent (`Vaani`) proactively calls the citizen **only** when a significant status change occurs (Solved, Rejected, Audit, or Overdue). This reduces anxiety for the citizen and call volume for the department.

## 📡 Dashboard Capabilities

* **Mission Control:** A futuristic **Glassmorphism-based** dashboard displaying live city stats, resolution rates, and pending tickets.
* **Live Signals:** Real-time feed of incoming voice complaints with status indicators (Overdue, Solved, Pending).
* **Department Analytics:** Interactive visualization (Chart.js) to monitor the performance load of **PWD, DJB, BSES, and MCD**.
* **Notification Center:** Live pop-up alerts for new complaints and evidence uploads.
* **Officer Profile:** Digital verification profile for the nodal officer with secure access levels.

## 📍 Operational Strategy: Zonal Decentralization

To ensure rapid response times and pinpoint accountability, we have moved away from a single "clogged" central helpline. **Delhi Sudarshan** implements a **Hyper-Local Operational Model** by dividing the capital into four strategic zones:

### 🧭 The 4-Zone Command Structure
* **South Zone | North Zone | East Zone | West Zone**
* Each zone is assigned a **Dedicated "Delhi Sudarshan" Helpline Number**.

### 🚀 Why This Matters?
* **High-Speed Response (Load Balancing):** By distributing call volume across four distinct nodes, we prevent system crashes during high-volume events (e.g., monsoon waterlogging) and ensure citizens never face a "Line Busy" tone.
* **Pinpoint Accountability:** Complaints are instantly mapped to the specific Zonal Nodal officer. This eliminates "passing the buck" between departments, as the jurisdiction is locked at the moment of the call.
* **Rapid Mobilization:** The Zonal AI Agent dispatches tickets directly to the nearest local field unit, bypassing central routing delays and cutting reaction time by 40%.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Glassmorphism), JavaScript (ES6+), Chart.js
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js (Stateless Middleware)
* **AI Core:** Google Gemini 2.5 Flash (Native Audio-to-Audio Processing)
* **Telephony:** Twilio Voice SDK (WebRTC) & Programmable SMS
* **Deployment:** GitHub Pages (Frontend) + Render (Backend) + Vercel(AI-Voice Agent)
